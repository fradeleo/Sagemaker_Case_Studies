# Machine Learning, Deployment Case Studies with AWS SageMaker

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying ML models using AWS SageMaker. This repository consists of a number of tutorial notebooks for various case studies, code exercises, and project files that will be to illustrate parts of the ML workflow and give you practice deploying a variety of ML algorithms.

### Tutorials

* Population Segmentation: Learn how to build and deploy unsupervised models in SageMaker. In this example, you'll cluster US Census data; reducing the dimensionality of data using PCA and the clustering the resulting, top components with k-means.
* Payment Fraud Detection: Learn how to build and deploy a supervised, LinearLearner model in SageMaker. You'll tune a model and handle a case of class imbalance to train a model to detect cases of credit card fraud.
* Deploy a Custom PyTorch Model (Moon Data): Train and deploy a custom PyTorch neural network that classifies "moon" data; binary data distributed in moon-like shapes.
* Time Series Forecasting: Learn to analyze time series data and format it for training a [DeepAR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html) algorithm; a forecasting algorithm that utilizes a recurrent neural network. Train a model to predict household energy consumption patterns and evaluate the results.
